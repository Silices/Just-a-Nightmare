<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Basic Idea

### Features

### Controlls

### Assets

### Built With

* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
Version: 4.26

<!-- DEV GUIDELINES -->
## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow

***Feature-Branch-Workflow***  
1. Before starting your work on a new feature, always pull the newest version of [main](https://github.com/nimaazha/OculusQuestFitnessApp/tree/main) branch.  
2. Create a new branch from main and give it a descriptive Name 
    * You can use your trello card id and name for this, which can be found in the card url (for example 12-decide-on-a-git-workflow)
3. You can now work on your feature, commit and push changes inside of your Feature Branch. Make sure to always choose **descriptive** commit messages.
4. Once you have pushed all your changes for the feature, create a pull request to main branch in GitHub and assign a team member for code review.
5. If your pull request has been approved, the pull request can be merged into main.
    * If you encounter merge conflicts, merge main branch into your feature branch **locally** and push the merge commit afterwards.

### Code Review 

This is a list of things you can look out for while doing code review:
* Does the code follow all naming conventions?
* Is the code too complex or can it be done simpler?
* Are all comments clear and helpful?
* Has the developer provided/updated documentation for their changes?
* Does the code function the way it is intended?
* Does the code follow our style guides?

### Other Guidelines

Always create your own scene if you want to test changes, the MainScene should be in a functioning state at all times.  
If you do make changes to a Scene you want to share, make sure to save your changes in unity before pushing to git.  
If you want to share Scene Elements with your team, create [Prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) and make sure they are placed properly.
